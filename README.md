- Each subgroup has followed naming conventions tailored to the technologies used in their development.
- A global naming standard for events, variables, and functions has been followed to ensure code consistency.
- Specific conventions for each subgroup are documented in the `README.md` files of the corresponding subproject repositories.

## 📦 Dependencies

Project dependencies are defined in the `pubspec.yaml` file. To install them, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## ▶️ Running the App

To run the app in debug mode:

```bash
flutter run
```

## 📱 Building the APK for Android Devices

To generate an installable `.apk` file for your Android device, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure dependencies are installed:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Build the APK in release mode:**

   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

   This will generate the `.apk` file located at:

   ```
   build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

3. **Transfer and install the APK on your Android device:**

   - Use a USB cable or a file-sharing app to move the `.apk` to your phone.
   - On the phone, open the file and allow installation from unknown sources if prompted.

> You can also use `flutter install` if your device is connected and developer mode is enabled.
